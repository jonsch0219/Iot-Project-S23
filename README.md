# Iot-Project-S23

## Overview
This project monitors the temperature and uses a LED and a discord bot to notify when the temperature has exceeded a upperbound which is dynamically set by the user. For someone with a basic knowledge of programming, webhooks, git and breadboards following this tutorial and setting up the project should not take more than an hour.

## Objective
I have chosen to do create this device to in a fun and rewarding way learn about "Internet of Things. Why this specific project was chosen is because I want to be able to monitor and control the temperature in my home in a preemptive way, which in this case means that the user should have a greater awarness of the the temperature in a specific environment. The temperature upper bound which is dynamically set by the user serves as a threshold. When the threshold is exceeded the user will be informed by a lit up LED and a notification on discord. This feature helps the user have greater control over the environment.

Example: User does not want the temperature in its appartment to exceed 30 degrees so it sets the upper bound to 30 degrees. When the upper bound is passed the user will be informed and can take actions such as opening a window, turning on a fan e.t.c to keep the temperature below its upper bound.
